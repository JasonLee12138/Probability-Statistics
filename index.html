<h1>Foreword</h1>
<div id="about-the-notes" class="section level2" number="0.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">0.1</span> About The Notes</h2>
<p>I am so honored to be one of the TAs of the undergraduate course <em>Probability and Statistics</em>. When I was in my first year of university, I found this course very interesting and intuitive (also not so challenging), which can be practically applied to so many scenarios. Later, I selected some more advanced courses, including <em>Probability Theory</em>, <em>Mathematical Statistics</em>, <em>Stochastic Analysis</em>, etc..</p>
<p>As I dug deeper and deeper into probability and statistics, I realized this is an absolutely delicate subject: on the one hand, it is so effective in solving all kinds of real-world problems and developing many useful theories; on the other hand, its theoretical foundation can be very intriguing and abstruse as well: if you really want to figure ALL THINGS out, you have to learn a lot more, like Real Analysis, Complex Analysis, Measure Theory… Intuitive things are truly built on solid foundations.</p>
<p>Therefore, I really want to help students in my class to learn it well and as easily as possible. Moreover, I can also utilize this opportunity to organize what I have learned in the past two years. Those are exactly why I want to produce the notes.</p>
<p>There are some points to notice:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Since the language used in the slides, homework assignments and possibly future exams is English, these notes will also be in <strong>English</strong> (for most parts, but you can also see some Chinese).</p></li>
<li><p>If any content on the notes contradicts with what the Professor said in class, maybe due to my typo or different understandings, please be aware that <strong>the Professor’s version shall prevail</strong> (which you should refer to first), and tell me straight about the discrepancies.</p></li>
<li><p>Because this is only a introductory course, there are definitely lots of important points that fail to be included in class but might be useful in the future (or theoretically important in constructing the knowledge system). Hence, I might provide some supplementary content in my notes for those who are interested. However, these materials <strong>have nothing to do with the exam</strong> and <strong>don’t worry</strong> if you cannot understand them. For the purpose of this course, you only have to master all the points taught in class and that’s <strong>ABSOLUTELY ENOUGH</strong> for your exam!</p></li>
</ul>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">0.2</span> Importance of This Course</h2>
<p>No matter you want to study Finance, Economics, Accounting or Marketing, <em>Probability and Statistics</em> is one of the most important courses for ALL of you, and I believe for most of you, it is the most important math course in the future (much more important and frequently used than <em>Advanced Mathematics（高等数学）</em> and <em>Linear Algebra（线性代数）</em>). For your future study, this course serves as an extremely important footstone.</p>
<p>To be more specific, there are some examples to illustrate the importance:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>When you study <em>Corporate Finance（公司财务）</em> or <em>Security Investment Analysis（证券投资学）</em>, understanding Markowit’s Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) requires a good understanding and application of probability and statistics knowledge, for example, explicitly calculating expectations adn variances.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to study theories about derivative pricing and valuation, you can never escape <em>Stochastic Calculus</em>, and this contemporary mathematical subject is mainly built on probability theory (and you even have to learn more for it). On two of Professor Chenxu Li’s well-known courses, <em>Mathematical Methods in Finance（金融中的数学方法）</em> and <em>Stochastic Analysis and Applications（随机分析与应用）</em>, those topics will be discussed in depth. I strongly recommend those who are interested in this kind of “hard-core” knowledge to select his courses.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Econometrics（计量经济学）</em> is the compulsory course for students majoring in Finance and Financial Economics. Econometrics can be understood as “Applied Statistics in Economics.” Linear Regression is the most important topic in this course, and no wonder it’s heavily based on your mastery of statistics.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="advice-on-how-to-learn-well" class="section level2" number="0.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">0.3</span> Advice on How to Learn Well</h2>
<p>As I mentioned, <em>Probability and Statistics</em> is way easier than other math courses, so you are supposed to be more confident in this course. Here are some tips for you:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There are some points that you have learned in your high school math, such as combinatorial numbers, independence of events. However, never get light-hearted about the lectures just because of that (in fact, many are not so easy to thoroughly understand). Since this course serves as an important foundation and prepares you well for future study, please pay more attention.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to succeed in exams, make sure you don’t miss anything on the slides and you have carefully completed your assignment. According to my experience, most of the problems on your exam paper won’t be unfamiliar to you. You can easily find a similar example/exercise in the slides or your homework. Therefore, try to figure out every problem you encountered.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t shy away from questions. If you have anything not fully absorbed or understood, feel free to ask the Professor or any of us TAs.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s definitely important to figure out tricks in solving problems. However, as for your future coursework, it’s more crucial for you to have an overall understanding of this course. After you finish it, if you can picture a clear mindmap about the organization of this course, how concepts are developed and interact with each other, I think you’ve harvested the most valuable in this class. For example, after you have learned basic probability theory, try organizing all that you learned and figuring out their relationship. In other words, carefully think about how we’ve proceeded so far, from definition of probability to Central Limit Theorem.</p></li>
</ul>
